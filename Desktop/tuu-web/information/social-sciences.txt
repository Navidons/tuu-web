THE UNITY UNIVERSITY FACULTY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES
DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES – Bachelors of Development Studies (BDS)
Background
Development Studies as a discipline originates from the post-Second World War period.  It was part of Modern Development theory that was developed to explain how former colonies of Britain, France, Portugal, Spain and other European powers should be developed.  Modern Development Theory was concerned about how to transform and make countries that were gaining independence more productive.
Therefore, a new theoretical framework to understand what was happening in Less Developed Countries (LDCs) became necessary. This resulted into a discipline of Development Studies.  This discipline is now taught in many institutions of higher learning around the world and Unity University would like to make a contribution by building a cadre of Human Resource to address development challenges.
Justification
In the last one and half decades, Somaliland has undergone rapid socio-economic and political development that calls for multidisciplinary training in critical issues concerned with development, democracy, peace, human rights, environment, public policy, gender and women studies.
