# Email Setup Guide for Samba Tours Website

This guide will help you set up Gmail SMTP for sending emails from your Samba Tours website.

## Prerequisites

1. A Gmail account
2. Gmail App Password (not your regular password)

## Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication

1. Go to your Google Account settings: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Navigate to "Security"
3. Enable "2-Step Verification" if not already enabled

## Step 2: Generate App Password

1. In your Google Account settings, go to "Security"
2. Find "App passwords" (only visible if 2FA is enabled)
3. Click "App passwords"
4. Select "Mail" as the app and "Other" as the device
5. Enter a name like "Samba Tours Website"
6. Click "Generate"
7. **Copy the 16-character password** (you won't see it again!)

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following variables:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="mysql://username:password@localhost:3306/samba_tours_db"

# Gmail SMTP Configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid credentials" error**
   - Make sure you're using the App Password, not your regular Gmail password
   - Verify 2-Factor Authentication is enabled

2. **"Less secure app access" error**
   - This is normal - Gmail will show this warning for app passwords
   - The app password is secure and recommended by Google

3. **Emails not sending**
   - Check your environment variables are correct
   - Verify the Gmail account has SMTP access enabled
   - Check the server logs for detailed error messages

4. **Emails going to spam**
   - This is common for new email setups
   - Add your Gmail address to the recipient's contacts
   - Consider using a domain email address for production

### Testing Email Configuration

Use the test endpoint to verify your setup:

```bash
# Test configuration
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-email

# Send test email
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "template": "contactConfirmation",
    "data": {
      "name": "Test User",
      "email": "test@example.com",
      "tourType": "Gorilla Trekking",
      "message": "Test message"
    }
  }'
```

## Production Considerations

1. **Use a domain email address** instead of Gmail for production
2. **Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC** records for better deliverability
3. **Monitor email logs** for delivery issues
4. **Consider using an email service** like SendGrid or Mailgun for high volume
5. **Implement email queuing** for better performance

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Regularly rotate your app passwords
- Monitor for unusual email activity
